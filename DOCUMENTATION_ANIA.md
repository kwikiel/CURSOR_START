Perfect!  
Hereâ€™s the **updated version** of your project brief â€” now including a **schema for both input and output**, formatted clearly.

# Project Overview

We are building a Next.js application that generates high-quality, realistic images using the Replicate API (model: **Sana Sprint 1.6B**).  
The application must prioritize speed, mobile-friendliness, and accessibility, with a strong emphasis on loading performance and best practices.

The app will be deployed on **Vercel**.

---

# Core Features
- **Prompt Input**: Users can enter a text prompt to generate an image.
- **Generate Button**: Users submit their prompt by clicking a button to trigger image generation.
- **App Description**: A short description will be placed above the input field, explaining the appâ€™s purpose and usage.
- **Image Display**: The generated image will be displayed once ready, with proper accessibility features.

---

# Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **API Integration**: Integrate with Replicate API using the **nvidia/sana-sprint-1.6b** model.
- **Testing**: 
  - Implement unit and integration tests to ensure app functionality and performance.
  - Recommended testing frameworks: Jest and Playwright or similar.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application using Vercel, leveraging performance-optimized settings.

---

# Performance Requirements
- Fast loading times across both mobile and desktop.
- Best practices for Next.js performance:
  - Image optimization (`next/image`)
  - Lazy loading
  - Code splitting and dynamic imports

---

# Accessibility Requirements
- Use semantic HTML structure.
- Ensure full keyboard navigation.
- Provide accessible labels and ARIA attributes for all interactive elements.
- Include descriptive `alt` text for all images.

---

# Design Requirements
- **Colors**:
  - Primary Color: `#D8E6FC`
  - Secondary Colors: `#f7f3ea`, `#3B424D`
- **Responsiveness**:
  - Fully responsive, mobile-first design.
  - Optimized layouts for various screen sizes and devices.
- **General Look and Feel**:
  - Clean, modern, and simple interface.
  - Easy-to-read typography and intuitive user flow.

---

# Image Generation Details
- Images must be high quality and realistic.
- Subjects (especially people) should appear natural and lifelike.
- The background should be softly blurred to emphasize the main subject.
- Target resolution: [to be confirmed â€” e.g., 1024x1024 pixels].

# API Integration

## Input Schema
```json
{
  "prompt": "string (required)",
  "num_outputs": "integer (optional, default: 1)",
  "image_dimensions": "string (optional, format: 'widthxheight', e.g., '1024x1024')"
}
```
- **prompt**: Text description provided by the user to guide the image generation.
- **num_outputs**: Number of images to generate (default is 1).
- **image_dimensions**: Desired output resolution, if supported by the model.

## Output Schema
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "created_at": "string (ISO 8601 datetime)",
  "completed_at": "string (ISO 8601 datetime)",
  "output": [
    {
      "image_url": "string (URL)",
      "thumbnail_url": "string (optional URL)"
    }
  ],
  "error": "string (nullable)"
}
```
- **id**: Unique identifier for the generation request.
- **status**: Current status (e.g., "processing", "succeeded", "failed").
- **created_at / completed_at**: Timestamps for tracking.
- **output**: Array containing one or more generated images.
- **error**: If the generation failed, error information will be available.

---

# Additional Considerations
- Handle loading states (e.g., spinners or skeleton screens) while images are being generated.
- Display error messages gracefully when generation fails.
- (Optional) Allow users to download or share the generated images.
- (Optional) Introduce simple prompt validations (e.g., length restrictions, prohibited content checks).
