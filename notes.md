## Development Process

For each enhancement:

1. **Plan**: Define what needs to be done and explore approaches
2. **Implement**: Write the code for the selected approach
3. **Review**: Check for bugs, edge cases, and improvements
4. **Test**: Verify functionality works as expected
5. **Commit**: Save your work with clear commit messages

## Using Cursor for AI Assistance

When implementing these features, use Cursor to:
- Generate implementation plans
- Get code suggestions
- Debug issues
- Understand unfamiliar APIs
- Generate tests

Remember to break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks for better AI assistance.
